Logins in to the RPi with aid of SSH, the script just opens the file which contains the password in form of text. It was pretty annoying at the time because i always forgot the IP and too tired for typing password in.

## Parameters passing ROS ([``` /cmd_line_rosparam ```](https://github.com/hpoleselo/tools/tree/master/cmd_line_rosparam))

Pass arguments from command line to rosparam and then extracting it in a Python script, example:

## CR Character error ([``` crCharactersConvert.py ```](https://github.com/hpoleselo/tools/blob/master/crCharactersConvert.py))

When getting this error: ``` env: python\r: No such file or directory ``` using the shebang on the beginning of your Python code CAN (rarely) be caused because of CR characters, which are line breakers from Java (\r). I really don't know why this happenned, but this script when ran, replaces all ```\r``` for empty. (MAKE SURE TO MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CODE) 

**You have to edit the opened file to be your python script.**

## Extension Searcher ([``` search_extension.py ```](https://github.com/hpoleselo/tools/blob/master/search_extension.py))

Place this program to the directory you want to check for Python files. It just checks all the files in the directory which has the .py extension. The goal is to use that to the automated printing process, which will take a parameter from the user and check if that parameter (file to be printed, gcode), exists.
